# Terraform_projects

Welcome to my Terraform Projects repository! This repository contains hands-on labs and small Terraform projects that I've resolved independently. Each project demonstrates a specific concept or use case in Terraform, from provisioning simple cloud resources to managing infrastructure as code.

## Overview

The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey with Terraform and showcase practical use cases. Each folder contains a separate project, complete with Terraform configuration files and a description of the use case.
